# sprout-wrap

This project uses [soloist](https://github.com/mkocher/soloist) and [librarian-chef](https://github.com/applicationsonline/librarian-chef)
to run a subset of the recipes in sprout's [cookbooks]((https://github.com/pivotal-sprout/sprout).

[Fork it](https://github.com/pivotal-sprout/sprout-wrap/fork) to 
customize its [attributes](http://docs.opscode.com/chef_overview_attributes.html) in [soloistrc](/soloistrc) and the list of recipes 
you'd like to use for your team. You may also want to add other cookbooks to its [Cheffile](/Cheffile), perhaps one 
of the many [community cookbooks](http://community.opscode.com/cookbooks). By default it configures an OS X 
Mavericks workstation for Ruby development.
